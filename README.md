# Dynamic-State-Estimation-Toolbox-DSET-

The Dynamic State Estimation Toolbox (DSET) is for performing power system dynamic state estimation by using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and several variants of the unscented Kalman filter (UKF).

The code can be used to generate the results in the following paper:

Junjian Qi, Kai Sun, Jianhui Wang, and Hui Liu, "Dynamic State Estimation for Multi-Machine Power System by Unscented Kalman Filter with Enhanced Numerical Stability," IEEE Trans. Smart Grid, in press. DOI: 10.1109/TSG.2016.2580584

Two cases are included: one for WSCC 3-machine 9-bus system and the other for NPCC 48-machine 140-bus system.

The EKF/UKF Toolbox is needed and can be downloaded at http://becs.aalto.fi/en/research/bayes/ekfukf/.

Run "test_UKFGPS_SRUKF.m" to get started.
